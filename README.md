# Iron-Barons
Iron Barons is a character-driven grand strategy game set in the 19th century.

After the restoration of absolute monarchies throughout Europe, the forces of liberalism lay dormant. Their defeat was not, however, final. Entrenched dynasties will struggle to adapt and survive throughout this new era, as new political forces are unleashed by industrialization and the transformation of society.
