Generally, the names of baronies, counties and duchies are written in the appropriate language for each cultural variation. For kingdoms and empires, however, this is rarely the case. For instance, there is a German cultural variation for the barony of Vienna as "Wien", and for the county/duchy of Lower Austria as "Nieder√∂sterreich", but none for the kingdom/empire of Austria, which is simply called "Austria" in the game even if it belongs to a German culture.
